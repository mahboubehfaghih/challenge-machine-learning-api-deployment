## Mission objectives
The real estate company "ImmoEliza" is really happy about your data collection using web scrapping. Whenever a new property comes on the market, the question of how it should be priced naturally arises.

Now, the company asks you to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales. "ImmoEliza" has hired you to build a tool that enables the company to predict property prices using linear regression.

Take the dataset that was previously scraped and preprocess the data to be used with machine learning.

In addition, they would like you to create an API to let their web-developers create a website around it.

Ideally, your API would ask a user to provide with information about a property (features) and return the estimated price using your model.
